# mp3_player

**Version 1.0.0**

Code and music files for MP3 Player project.

MP3 Player Python program exploring mixer from the modules PYGAME for audio reproduction and implementing a user interface with filedialog from module TKINTER (buttons, file dialog and log text output in the Console).

To test it, clone this repository and run final_project.py on any IDE. You might have to isntall pygame first if you don't have it already. I use Pycharm for windows.

I have also programmed another version of this player on repl.it, which is different because for reproducing audio in repl.it the library AUDIO is used.  https://github.com/cjvalverde/mp3_player_replit_version
